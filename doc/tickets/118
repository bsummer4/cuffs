summary: Ticket Management System

Write a ticket-manipulation suite similar to the "mh" email system.
In fact, it might be possible to just hack mh itself to work with my
ticket system.  A session might look like this:

    $ scan `pick -author ben`
    117 12/09 ben installation<<Get "make install" to work.>>
    118 12/09 ben Ticket Management System<<Write a ticket-manipulation suite
    $ close 118 -m "It's in place!  Enjoy!" -git
    $ scan `pick -author ben`
    117 12/09 ben installation<<Get "make install" to work.>>
    $ head 118 | egrep "status|place"
    status: resolved
    resolution: It's in place!  Enjoy!
    $ git log 118
