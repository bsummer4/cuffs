The Generator Test function is designed to follow most, but not all, of the
specifications in the State_Generator_Test.pdf file. In order to execute the
file all, one must simply enter "make check" into the terminal. Then it will
print 10 state messages and exit. These state messages follow our message protocol
and contain random data generated within the file. This test works except it 
does not read the time from the global virtual time. That will be taken care of in
CMBclientTest and CMBgo.sh. These tests are the proof-of-concept and display a
fully-functioning CMB state manager.
