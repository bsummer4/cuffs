@section Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the doxygen page for the Fistacuffs project. Please refer to the left frame
for how to get around. 

A good idea is to look at the "Modules" Tree, as it will show you different "Modules" that breaks up
our code into more logical blocks for ease of navigation through documentation. 

This main page is mostly a placeholder of sorts for now. I'm sure it will be improved in the future. 

@section Tests

For tests documenation you can look at a few places. 
  -# The doc/testing directory of the source tree. 
  -# The Test List on the left
  -# The Tests Module on in the "Modules" tree, where the test sources themselves are documented. 

@section Building

Building the project is pretty standard as we use autotools. 
  -# Run ./Bootstrap
  -# Run ./configure 
  -# Run make 
And then if you wish to run the tests:
  -# Run make check

@section Requirements
Our project is assuming that you have a few things on your system installed. Configure does its best
to make sure you have them installed, but it's not as perfect as it should be. 
  -# boost (specifically the threading library, but we'll use more with time)
  -# swig (to build the python bindings)
  -# Python development packages (and obviously python as well)
  -# doxygen (if you want to build the documentation)
  -# docutils (again if you want to build the rst documenation)
