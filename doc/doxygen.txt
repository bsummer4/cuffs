@section Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the Doxygen page for the Fistacuffs
project. Please refer to the left frame for how to get around.

Our game has a set of namespaces, the best way to navigate through
is to probably look at each namespace.

The Noteable namespaces that our game uses in no particular order is:
  -# @ref game
  -# @ref physics
  -# @ref vectors
  -# @ref sdl
  -# @ref cmb

The code is very modular, so to understand the ordering of how everything
goes together, look at @ref Pipeline

@section Tests

For tests documentation you can look at a few places.
  -# The doc/testing directory of the source tree.
  -# The Test List on the left
  -# The Tests Module on in the "Modules" tree, where the test sources
     themselves are documented.

@section Building

Building the project is pretty standard as we use autotools.
  -# Run ./Bootstrap
  -# Run ./configure
  -# Run make

And then if you wish to run the tests:
  -# Run make check

@section Requirements

Our project is assuming that you have a few things on your system
installed. Configure does its best to make sure you have them
installed, but it's not as perfect as it should be.
  -# boost (specifically the threading library, but we'll use more with time)
  -# swig (to build the python bindings)
  -# Python development packages (and obviously python as well)
  -# Doxygen (if you want to build the documentation)
  -# docutils (again if you want to build the rst documentation)
