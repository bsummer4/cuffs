@section Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the doxygen page for the Fistacuffs project. Please refer to the left frame
for how to get around. 

A good idea is to look at the "Modules" Tree, as it will show you different "Modules" that breaks up
our code into more logical blocks for ease of navigation through documentation. 

This main page is mostly a placeholder of sorts for now. I'm sure it will be improved in the future. 

@section Tests

For tests documenation you can look at a few places. 
  -# The doc/testing directory of the source tree. (depricated, we're trying to keep everything on doxygen now)
    - Specifically the switchbox testing doc is here
  -# The Test List on the left
  -# The Tests Module on in the "Modules" tree, where the test sources themselves are documented.
