# Building
You only need to run the first command if you've checked out this code
from a repository.  Tarball releases will have had that done for you
already.

    $ ./Bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

# Directories
- /doc -- All Documentation; Formatted in ReStructured Text.
- /Bootstrap -- Shell script for generating the build.
- /switchbox -- A tool for group communication over the network.
- /game -- The game itself.

# Prerequisites

## Building Doxygen Documentation
The output is generated in ./doc/doxygen, and the docs are available
online at http://www.cs.utk.edu/~jhoare/cs594ng/doxygen

    $ make doxygen-doc

# Coding Style
C source files are .c and .h, c++ source files are .c++ and .h++.
Style rules for c++ and c are codified by using code beautifiers.
Here are the options we use:

    astyle -Uas4 # for c++ code
    indent -npsl -i4 -npcs -bli0 -brs -brf -br -nut # for pure c code
