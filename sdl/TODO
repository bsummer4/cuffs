* TODO Finish prims
  - Arguments to most prims aren't right (should be grouped into lists)

* TODO Finish work with ents
  - Right now, it's assumed that all ents are circles.
  - Probably need one-class-per-ent or something similar.
  - What's a good general protocol for ents?

* TODO Implement 'Event Hooks'
  Make it more similar it says in README.  On the other hand, It sort-of
  works the way it now; Maybe just leave it?

* TODO Cleanup Tcl C Code
  - There's lot of repetition.  Write some functions or macros to clean it
    up.
  - Acutually do error handling!

* TODO Update README.md
  When the implementation becomes more stable, rewrite the README to
  reflect the actual API.

* TODO Use a 'safe interp'
  Use a sandboxed interpreter for stdin messages.  Take, as a command-line
  argument, a script to run unsandboxed.  Then, everything after that runs
  in the sandbox.
