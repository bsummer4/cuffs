* TODO Implement 'Event Hooks'
  Make it more similar to the way it's described in README.md.  On the
  other hand, It sort-of works the way it is now; Maybe just leave it?

* TODO Cleanup Tcl C Code
  - There's lot of repetition.  Write some functions or macros to clean it
    up.
  - Actually do error handling!

* TODO Update README.md
  When the implementation becomes more stable, rewrite the README to
  reflect the actual API.
