* TODO Cleanup Tcl C Code
  - There's lot of repetition.  Write some functions or macros to clean it
    up.
  - Actually do error handling!

* TODO Update README.md
  When the implementation becomes more stable, rewrite the README to
  reflect the actual API.

* TODO Cleanup ents code
  It's a bit redundant.  Find ways to clean it up.  Mostly, I'm just no
  that familar with snit yet.
