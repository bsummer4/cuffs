* TODO Finish Input Sending
  The input monitoring code is complete, however, in the test code,
  it's not setup to actually print everything (mouse position changes,
  and mouse button changes are not printed).

* TODO Add all the old 'prims'
  Add all the drawing shapes that we were using in the previous
  implementation.

* TODO Finish work with 'ents'
  The loop is in place, but the commands need to be implemented.

* TODO Implement 'Event Hooks'
  As it says in README

* TODO Cleanup Tcl proc definitions in Draw()
  There's lot of repitition.  Write some functions or macros to clean it
  up.
