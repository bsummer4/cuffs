# Game

This is where the code that ties together all the other modules goes.

## Ideas

The code here will probably consist of a script to inject into sdlsh,
and a bunch of shell scripts.

### Installation

There should be a single executable named 'cuffs' placed in the path.
It should be generated by the makefile and should export environment
variables so that the programs it forks off will know where to find data,
other programs, etc.   Most everything will go in '$DESTDIR/lib/cuffs/'.
