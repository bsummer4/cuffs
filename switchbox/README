@par Switchbox

A program for handling routing between programs.  There is a client
library for connecting to and creating messages to be sent through the
switchbox.  This library is in c and has bindings for python, and c++.

@par Running

@verbatim
usage: switchbox [port]
@endverbatim

If you pass a port of 0 or you don't pass a port, it will just use
some available port.

@par Standard Output

We output when we start listening, and we the port we ended up using.

@verbatim
    $ ./switchbox
    listening
    port 532992
@endverbatim

We might eventually add status updates for other events, like
connections and disconnections.  For now, there is no need.

@par Client Library

Basically, when you want to do things with the switchbox, you:

  - Open a socket with @ref open_connection (from message.h)
  - Create a message with one of the functions: (maybe
    @ref string_to_message)
  - Send the message with @ref switchbox_send
  - Receive with @ref switchbox_receive

Messages have a 16 byte binary header, and then a payload.  The
switchbox does different routing based on the information in the
header.  There are special "routing types" for actually controlling
the switchbox.  These let you create and remove groups, etc.

The library headers file 'src/switchbox_client.h' and 'src/message.h'
are designed to be human readable.  See them for more specific
information.
