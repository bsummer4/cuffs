title: Clean up the switchbox Code and Separate it from the Game.
status: resolved

Remove all the stuff we're not using and replace the build with a simple
Makefile.  Makefile should have rules: 'all switchbox install dist clean'.

All code should be pure c99.  Remove the python and c++ bindings since they
are not being used.
