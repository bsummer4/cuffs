Documentation
=============

We have pretty good docs between the doxygen stuff, doc/readme.rst,
and doc/design.rst.

You can see most of our docs at
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~jhoare/cs594ng/

And in there you can look at the doc.html which is built from all the
.rst files in /doc as well as the doxygen documentation by clicking on
the doxygen directory.

You can build the doxygen docs yourself as well.

./Bootstrap
./configure
make doxygen

And then open the html file: doc/doxygen/html/index.html

If you look at the main page, it should tell you a lot more thoroughly
where to look and more information.


Status with respect to this timebox
===================================

Our code is not really 'there' yet.

- The 'overworld' server (which doesn't use CMB), is working but buggy
  (with no automated tests yet).

- A lot of code has been written for the 'Battle' stuff.  The
  interpreter, generator, gameState aren't very mature yet.  There is
  an experimental fork in one of the branches.

  Ben Says: I'm under the impressions that the Networking code and the
            map code works, but I haven't read or tried it myself so I
            can't say for sure.

Thanks,
