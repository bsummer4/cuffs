A starting place to see our documentation is by looking at our doxygen documentation. 

You can see most of our docs at
http://www.cs.utk.edu/~jhoare/cs594ng/

And in there you can look at the doc.html which is built from all the .rst files in /doc
as well as the doxygen documentation by clicking on the doxygen directory. 

You can build the doxygen docs yourself as well. 

./Bootstrap
./configure
make doxygen

And then open the html file: doc/doxygen/html/index.html

If you look at the main page, it should tell you a lot more throughly where to look and more 
information.
