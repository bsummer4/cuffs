CMBclientTest is a binary file, that will be executed by the CMBgo.sh bash 
script. CMBclientTest generates an generator, synchronizer, and interpreter
and establishes a CMB state manager and communicates with other machines
via a Connection object. This file is executed on the client machines
(hardcoded as hydra4 and hydra5) and takes the server's hostname on the 
eecs domain (as in star, hydra2, cetus4) from STDIN. 

CMBgo.sh is a shell command that will, if it works, run the switchbox on
the current client, run the CMBclientTest on two separate machines. The
ouptut will be routed to whatIsaid4.txt and whatIsaid5.txt respectively.
Also, I should output the state messages generated to a file and see if they
were "interpreted".
