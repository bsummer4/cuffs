title: Discuss the game concept

Have to work on coming up with a single model for our game. Long
debates will help, but it'd be better if we could come to SOME
compromise. Discuss.

Met yesterday for 2 hours.

Came up with two basic concepts:

1. Game with two parts:
2. "game-board" view with discrete points held by rival
   factions. Choosing to attack a neighboring faction's point will go
   into a
3. smaller game made up of players from each team. The results of the
   smaller game will determine who wins the attack in the game-board
   view.

A second game was also designed, but Ben could probably explain it
better.

Met Thursday with Dr. Huang, and it looks like we're going with
concept (1) above (Also see my notebook entry) We met today and have a
set of tasks that need to get done.

- Gameboard
- Worms Battleground
- Physics
- Switchbox
- Map Manager / Maps
- Possibly finding a 2d system to replace ogre.
- Set up & use autotools

SDL looks promising:

Also, if we have options for the libraries, we should consider using
openAL instead of fmod.

I feel like we have the basic concept down enough. I think further
refinements should be contained to new tickets.
