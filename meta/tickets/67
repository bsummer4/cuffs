title: Rework the Connection class to use the handleEvent protocol
date: 2009-11-20T00:23:36Z
status: closed

This should remove a lot duplicated code (between the connection class
and the handleEvent() stuff) and make the connection object more
flexible since it can be easily connected to a great number of other
objects.

This should be done in the branch to avoid breaking the stuff in
trunk.

I'm going to call this done.  It doesn't have all of the features that
we need yet, but I think the core functionality is there.  I think
adding the other features we use will not require any modification to
the switchbox::Connection class.
