Let very-high projectiles survive longer than very-low ones.

I've given up on this.  I'll keep this ticket open until I have
bug-free edge-walls implemented.

What was your difficulties with this ticket?

I have it working with wrapping right now with the following problems:

1. Explosions do not wrap around to the other side.

2. The collision detection is screwed up because it looks for the
point closest to the player, and it does not wrap.

I think I can fix 2, but I'm not sure how to fix 1.
