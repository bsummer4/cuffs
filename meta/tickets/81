title: Troubles building in branch (on my mac) - main not found

If I fix the problems in #79 by changing references to pointers, I get
the following error when trying to build:

        g++ -I/opt/local/include -I/sw/include -I../src -I../../../trunk/src/switchbox/ -L/opt/local/lib -L/sw/lib -lboost_thread ../../../trunk/src/switchbox/.libs/message.o ../../../trunk/src/switchbox/.libs/switchbox_client.o -lSDL -lSDL_image ../../../trunk/src/switchbox/.libs/Connection.o -lSDL_draw sync_cat.o -o sync_cat
        Undefined symbols:
          "_main", referenced from:
              start in crt1.10.6.o
        ld: symbol(s) not found
        collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
        make: *** [sync_cat] Error 1

When I check the symbols of the file (I modified the makefile to
create .o files first for debugging reasons)

    I get the following:
    jhoare@ijohn:~/dashinggents_fistacuffs/branch/simpler-gamestate/utils$ nm sync_cat.o | grep main
    0000000000000a36 T _SDL_main
    000000000000fc10 S _SDL_main.eh
    000000000000888d s __ZZ8SDL_mainE8__func__

So there's no _main function like there should be, and I can't figure
out why. Is this happening on anybody else's systems?

I'm fine with you committing your changes.  The references thing is wrong.

It works fine for me, with and without the pointer patch.

Is it only sync_cat, or do none of the executables build?

It's not only sync_cat, but some do build.

sync_cat, interpret, render, keylisten, map-pgm Fail to build due to
the error.

game doesn't build because of errors forming reference to reference,
so it doesn't even get to the linking step yet.

It's something funny going on with SDL. Possibly once we use autotools
it will probably set these flags for us correctly anyway. I still
can't build renderer, but all the others seem to build (except game).
