Before you are a list of the tasks I was assigned to finish. I'll try
to work as much as possible Friday. Here's my crap:

- Finish "CMBgo.sh". This shell command hosts a switchbox and calls
  two (or more) machines to run "CMBclientTest", which will send the
  CMB triad to the switchbox. Output is routed now and this is VERY
  messy. I expect to refine most of it tomorrow morning to make it
  bearable for whomever takes this.

- Write docs. I'll take care of the generator docs and the "basics"
  for CMBclientTest and CMBgo.sh. Just edit these with your changes.

This should not be a ticket.  I added a message to replace this.
