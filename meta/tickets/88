Extend our overworld-server to support:

# New Features
## Chat
Show everything that has been said in a textbox and allow text to be
send from another text field.  This should be written to echo all
traffic then, when that's done, only show actual messages.

## Teams
Be able to choose any team any time.  We maybe could add support for
associating players with teams but get all this working first.

## Rooms
Basically hard code 4 rooms.  Keep game joining rules exactly how they
are now, but make the player-list only show people in the current
room.  Have a special room that you start in that doesn't allow you to
start games but shows all players.

# Protocol Changes
You will need a to specify rooms and teams now.  The traffic should
look something like this:

    /identify ben:red:lobby
    /list
    /players ben:red:lobby peter:blue:top-left fred:green:top-left
    /identify ben:green:top-left
    /list
    /players ben:green:top-left peter:red:top-left fred:green:top-left
    /play ben,fred peter

This format minimizes protocol changes.  Note that /play will need to
accept two lists now.

someone please take this until then.
