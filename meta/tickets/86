The architecture has stabilized enough to be documented.  Makes sure
all documentation is up-to-date and through.

There should be:

- A comprehensive overview of the design of the game and all the
  little message formats we're using in design.rst
- A short summary of every non-trivial class
- A comment for every non-obvious namespace
- A comment describing the purpose of every .cpp file in game/src
- Add comment support to the test-files and describe what's being
  tested
- Several README files describing building, the layout of the code and
  how to approach reading various sections.
- A good Doxygen front-page which walks a user through obtaining,
  building, and install the code, and describes how the rest of the
  documentation is layed out (including the doxygen stuff itself).
- Add a FOR_TA file that simply redirects the TA to the other
  documentation, and talks a little about grading specific elements

I am working on making sure that doxygen build looks right.

Fixed doxygen.cfg to include local classes.  Improved the main page to
be a better introduction to the project and places to look.

I'm going to place the movie of us playing on my youtube account. I'll
place the link in the file.

Everybody look at the documentaion to make sure it looks okay. I've
put the images on the main page as well as a link to the youtube. (I
couldn't embedd it in the page b/c doxygen wants to do its own
formatting, Perhaps its possible to embed raw html but not that I
could find.

resolved: fixed

Changeset [fistacuffs:703]:

Doxygend lots of ben's README's and comment blocks.

Documented the pipeline a bit. Added a media section to the
main page.

Tweaked some doxygen.cfg paremeters.

Added documentation to a lot of the programs.
A description of each program now shows up on the doxygen page.

Every namespace variable is documented at least with a @brief
description.

I'm going to say this Resolves #85 but everyone should take a look to make
sure they agree.
