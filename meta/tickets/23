title: The c++ Connection Lib Should Rely More on the switchbox_client Library
date: 2009-09-29T03:00:36Z
status: closed

The Connection code should never create a socket or build (malloc) a
message itself.  Things like defgroup and undefgroup should be in the
switchbox_client.  Etc.

Is this necessary? Do we NEED a C client library?
