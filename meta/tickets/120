title: Add a message to flip bits on the map.

It will only need the indexes of each bit, and will need to be
specified in ascii.  You need to be able to represent numbers between
0 and 480,000.  If I remember correctly there is a common way to
repersent binary numbers with ascii using 64 different characters.  So
that give you 6 bits to the byte:

    800x600 = 480,000
    2^(6 * 4) = 16,777,216

If we keep our message lengths bellow 255 that gives us (255 - 5) / 4
= 62 pixels per message.  Here is flipping the first four pixels:

    flip 0000000100020003
