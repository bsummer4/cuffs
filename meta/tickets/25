Cool.  When I was reading the code, I wondered why you didn't do it
that way.  One remark: Is this code snippet a bug?:

[latency_test.cpp]
> > SBMessage * msg = (SBMessage*) malloc(size);
> > msg = r->getMessage();

resolved: fixed

Yes, that's a bug. The message should also get freed, which never
happens. I've fixed this and committed it.
