Write some code that takes the game State and the renderer, then
produces a list of messages for the renderer.

You will need to:

- Come up with a way of associating state-object 'types' with images.
  The simplist thing would be to have the images names be the same as
  the type.  So "$type.pgm"
- See what images the renderer hasn't loaded yet, and send "image
  $type $type.pgm".
- Create a 'draw' message for every object in the state.
- Create a 'flip' message
- Return a vector of these messages.

Actually, make a list of all types and load their images when we make
the renderer.

There needs to be some way to determine the order in which to draw things.

This is primitive and has bugs, but I think it's good enough for a
prototype game.
