title: CMB Does not Advance time as far as it should
date: 2009-12-01T01:06:34Z
status: closed

It does not go as far as it should, it just advances once.

ie (syntax client timestamp message)
    0 3.0 3
    0 4.0 4
    0 5.0 5
    1 6.0 6
Will result in output of
    3
Instead of
    3
    4
    5
Like it should
