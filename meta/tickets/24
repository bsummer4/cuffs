title: Make SwitchboxAdmin keep track of all groups
date: 2009-09-29T03:07:35Z
status: closed

It should hold a data structure of all the groups it has defined.  It
should also implement a more abstract view of the group changing
process.  It should have methods for adding people to groups, removing
them, etc.

I created a new file called SwitchboxGroupControl.cpp to handle this
stuff, but I noticed there's some commented code in SwitchboxAdmin.cpp
that has similar methods. Can anyone explain?

It was decided that this functionality would be included in the "game"
portion of the code. So putting it off for now.
