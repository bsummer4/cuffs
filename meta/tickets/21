Yo, Ben. Since you're updating the switchbox in the branch directory,
would you be so kind to document any major changes made between the
two. You aren't saying much of what's going on and it puts us all
behind if we have to parse through the code for changes.

The only functional changes are the ANNOUNCEMENT mechanism, which was
discussed via email.  Everything else is just style, and small
bugfixes.

So, reading through my commit messages, they seem pretty clear and
through.  What's the problem?  You are reading the commit messages...
Right?

You really should review everything I commit; Notice my stupid
mistakes, make sure my design decisions are sound.  If you don't
understand why I did something, bring it up.  I read all of youall's
changes.
