our graphics grade...

Gonna say. Wrong! It's on my machine but I'm stealing a friends
internet. The model should be in simple-gamestate/data but I'll move
it over. Going to write a splash page to get this done.

Chris, Perhaps instead of making an ogre lab, you can generate a movie
of the model rotating in blender or something, and then we can just
play/show that movie instead of having all the Ogre stuff. Thoughts?

Good enough. It's an elegant solution. I'll implement it tonight.
