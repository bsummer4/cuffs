So I have sb_io working on one machine, and so I've closed the other
ticket. This one is for running on this machine.

If someone can look at the MonitorConnection class in my
ConnectionManager.(c|h)pp files that would be nice. The
handleAnnounceMessage() function isn't being called. It looks the same
as switchboxAdmin's which does this sucessfully...

Is this intentional?
    Con*Man*.hpp:
    MonitorConnection* forwarderConnetion;
    MonitorConnection * forwarderConnection;

It looks fine.  Are you absolutely sure the object is otherwise set up
correctly?  I don't see where you're starting it, etc.

Due to time constraints and lack of necessity it looks like this isn't
getting done.
