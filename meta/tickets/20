title: Implement Switchbox Control Protocol Client library

I've created a SwitchboxAdmin class which inherits from the Connection
class that I created earlier. Implement the functions to enable
control of the switchbox administrative functions. Documentation can
be built by doing a make doxygen-doc, as well as reading the comments
in the source files.

I am using this library in my testing functions, so the tests are
actually testing that these classes work as well.

Wrote addToGroup() and removeFromGroup() functions in the Switchbox
Admin Class.

John did most on this. I'll try to enable get functions to grab
specific groups, though it may be unnecessary later.

In retrospect, implementing get_group functions are unnecessary until
we implement the tree data structure for our group hierarchy. So for
now this will be on hold.

This works.  It should be improved, but that will go in other tickets.
