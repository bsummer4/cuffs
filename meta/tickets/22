title: Resolve Multicast Issue in SwitchboxAdmin
date: 2009-09-29T02:52:26Z
status: resolved

SwitchboxAdmin needs to override Connection's announcement handling
mechanism.  It needs to have a way of indicating when an operation
(such as defining a group) has finished.

def_group and undef_group maybe should have an option to not return
until the switchbox confirms the changes (maybe a timeout argument?).

Fixing this should make all the tests work so we can merge the
improve-switchbox branch.
