title: Implement a referee client.

# Referee
- Take two lists of player id's on command line:  for example:
      ./ref ben:chris john:daniel

- Connects to the 'Battle' switchbox
- Waits for all clients to join (They will need to '/identify' themselves)
- Place all the player objects ('/new player-[player-id] player x y')
- Starts Game '/start'
- This all happens before the cmb is started.  Clients start their
  CMB's when they see the /start message.

# Maybe
If we get to it, the ref should collect information about the battle
and report it over another switchbox.  However, this shouldn't be
worked on until the above is working.

At first, take a number of clients instead of lists of names. So:

    ./ref 4

Then wait for four people to /identify (ignore the names), set up
arbitrary spawn points (don't even look at the *.map), and broadcast
the /start message.

I made this use stdout and stdin.  We will have to double-pipe it to sb-cat
