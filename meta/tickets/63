# Audio
Extend the renderer to support audio.  Rename the
'new id imagefile' command to 'image id imagefile', then add two
commands for audio:

- 'sound id soundfile'
- 'play id'

Add the appropriate methods for handling these.  You will need another
std::map for the sounds.

It still makes sense to call this a renderer.  It is just 'rendering'
the sounds.
