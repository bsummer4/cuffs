Right now the launching is a bit flaky, and there is no support for
exiting or winning at all.

This is working pretty well.  We need some more testing before we can
close this.

What is working well and what is not?  The launching seems to be
fairly consistent now, but I don't know how/if we handle winning right
now.  I think that the launcher should NOT worry about closing the
server/switchbox as it leaves room for multiple games to be played.

This works pretty well.  We decided not to support winning.
