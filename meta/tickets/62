title: Modify Synchronizer to accept New CMB Timestamp ##.##

Where 0 is the last message. So if you have ##.0 you have all the messages.

Strip the timestamp before you send the message to the event handler.

Changeset [fistacuffs:397]:

Created the CMBSynchronizer (in trunk) to allow our new style
timestamps.  It should also handle the "old ones" as it did before,
however it will spit errors.  Also the CMBSynchronizer does not
forward the timestamp along to the interpreter anymore.

I also renamed one of the tests to what it really should have been but
I was too lazy to before.  Likewise, I have updated the tests to work
with the new system.

Resolve #61
