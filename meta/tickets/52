title: Redesign the Generator/Interpreter/State system
date: 2009-10-31T14:13:38Z
status: closed

The way it's currently done could be so much more elegant and simpler.
It currently makes little sense, and leaves holes such as the fact
that the generator is going to be ahead of the state object
(synchronizer is going to slow things down so that the state object is
behind the generator, yet the generator changes the x position and the
y position of a projectile--the renderer will draw based on the state
position).  Suggestions have been to dumb down the interpreter and
state to only house other player's objects (based on incoming
messages), have the generator have its own list of objects and
generate messages based on these.
