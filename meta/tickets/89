title: Drawing primitives on SDL Surfaces.

We need to be able to draw a line with a width and draw a solid circle
with radius.  Drawing should wrap around the sides but shouldn't wrap
top-bottom.  Don't draw off the image (segfault).

I don't want to do this.  Anyone else?

Have you looked at
[SDL_gfx](http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/
"SDl_gfx-2.0").  It may be better than SDL_Draw.  I've got a lot of
papers and finals this coming week, so can't promise I can get to it.
