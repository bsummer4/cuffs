Run switchbox through valgrind, and make sure It's not leaking memory.

I will try to put this as one of the tests.

I haven't set up the automated tests to do it. (My main reason is that
valgrind doesn't work on OS X Snow Leopard. So I need to check if
valgrind exists.) However, I did run the program through
Instruments.app and it found a memory leak in the send_error()
function, which I have presumably fixed.

Added the valgrind checks. It runs in quiet mode and outputs to a
file. If the file is not empty, then the switchbox test fails.
