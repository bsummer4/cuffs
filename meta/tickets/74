- Have a referee that places players along the top of the screen, and
  changes the wind every once in a while.
- Have clients that (after the ref says to /start) drop rocks from the
  players position whenever he presses space.

This is a pretty through test of everything working.  Once this is
done we can start adding game features.

All that's left is:

- Make the time-stamp behavior less flaky (use an offset from some
  start-time instead of the number of times in the game-loop)
- Fix bugs
- Find a better way of starting everything
- Make the ref change the wind periodically
- Make the wind/gravity a float.
- Make rocks actually start at the player location, and don't do
  anything if there is no player object in the game.

SDL_Draw sucks.  It doesn't pay attention to borders, so it will wrap
circles, and it will segfault if you draw near the bottom-right.
Shame.
