title: Sometimes we can't open a socket again after we just closed

Sometimes the sockets don't get closed properly, and we cannot reopen
them for a little while.

I have not experienced this.  Any idea when this is happening?

I'm not sure.  I think it might be that we're not closing a socket
upon exit sometimes, but that's completely a guess.

I was assuming it was the exit procedure. Is there any way to force a
safe-exit when a win-condition is satisfied?

It should be already.  Maybe the switchbox is being 'kill'ed when
things are still attached to it.  That might cause problems.... donno.

Perhaps a "good" way of handling this is to create a seperate program
that just launches the server. Or we could just launch the server
ourselves and not use the launcher's ability to do that. The server &
switchbox could/should stay on persistantly anyway.

The problem is that the shell script says "kill" server, which isn't
giving it a chance to close its sockets.  Couple ways to fix this:
catch the sigterm and close the sockets in that.  Or instead of using
kill in the script to kill the server, have it echo a message like
"/kill" to the switchbox/server which the server then handles, closes
all its sockets, and goes....Or at least that's my speculation

This is a TCP thing. In reality probably the best and most correct way
to do it is what i said in comment 5.

However, I don't see it really worthwhile as this whole project is
basically over.
