title: Synchronizer should take in a vector of proccesses to expect.

Ignore anything from users not in the list.

Remove older styles of adding users. (I.e. Adding them when we get a
message from them.)

This needs to be reintegrated since it didn't make it through the merge.

Okay good, I was just coming in here to ask if this needs to be done.

I've put them in, but how does game/sync-cat know what to set the list
of users to?

'game' will know from the ref-handshake.  'sync-cat' could take a list
of addresses on the command-line or you could include support for the
current method.  I'll leave that decision to you.

I was looking at the ref handshake, and it looks like the ref just
tells about the names of the users, not their addresses. Am I
incorrect?

The users /identify themselves, so we should be able to get their
addresses from the message headers.  This is not currently being done.

I was wrong.  This is is being handled now.

    void ref_handshake(string username, map <int, string> &players,
                       string &map) {
      cout << "/identify " << username << endl;
      LOOP {
        char buffer[1024];
        if (!cin.getline(buffer, 1024)) assert(false && "badness");
        istringstream i(buffer); int from; string command;
        i >> from >> command;
        if (!command.compare("/identify")) {
          string name; i >> name;
          players[from] = name;
          continue; }
        if (!command.compare("/map")) { i >> map; continue; }
        if (!command.compare("/start")) return;
        throw runtime_error("Bad handshake message"); }}

Okay, once you do that I can check in my changes to the Synchronizer.

EDIT: Oh I see whats happening there, players is a map and I can
iterate through it. Doh!

As an aside, I think most of my tests are obsolete now.

Alright, is there anything important that we're not testing now?

resolved: fixed

Changeset [fistacuffs:535]:

This checkin solves two things:

1. Resolves #75 : Add synchronizer to take in a vector of Processes to expect
2. Affects #83 : Adds A couple of CMB tests. Although a lot of them
   are depricated in favor of the testing methods ben did. However,
   perhaps we can still move the test cases into the other style.
