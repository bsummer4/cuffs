title: Incorrect usage of references

Using References in the STL prevents building on my mac (And is
possibly incorrect).

In my quest to try to do work on my Mac I keep hitting problems
building things.

One of these problems is it doesn't want to build when you're using
references in the STL containers. After doing some research, it looks
like its not valid to actually use references in the STL containers.

In this thread theres two proposals: 1.) Use pointers instead, or 2.)
use boost::reference_wrapper

So if this thread is correct, I'm confused why this works in linux but
not on my mac.

Thanks.  I'm aware of this but haven't changed it yet.  When I wrote
this I was very inexperienced with c++.

game.c++ is still not building for me unfortunatly. Although with time
as an issue it may not be worth actually worrying about it.

Sorry I was premature, we can deal with the other stuff in the other
ticket.
