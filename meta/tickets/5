title: Create Subversion Repository

I do not have the permissions to create the subversion repository, so
someone else will need to do it.

I don't know how unfuddle creates the structure but there should be
three folders in the subversion after it is created:

- trunk
- branches
- tags

I think this means you, Chris.  Maybe you could you just make us admins?

Everyone is an admin now.  I'm not sure how that happened.  Anyway, I
can't figure out how to create a repository on the site.

As far as I can tell I think Chris needs to do it... I can't figure
out how to create it. I'm assuming there should be a button on the
"repositories" page
