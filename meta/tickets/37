title: Create Documentation to build Into Doxygen

Document all the "C" library stuff (and possibly the switchbox itself)
so that it all builds into doxygen. It should probably go Under the
Switchbox/ClientLib Module. For examples look at the Connection.hpp
file.

Not unless you find a better way to do this.  The Doxygen comments in
Connection.hpp are hideously verbose.  I feel the comments for the
switchbox code are pretty decent; If there is a way to make Doxygen
play nice with the existing comment structure then I'm all for it.
