title: Support Dropped Connections in game

This entails:

- Make switchbox-connect display "-1 lost_connection 3" messages
- Make the synchronizer understand said messages and removed them from
  the queue.
- Make the ref understand these messages and send "/delete player-foo"
  messages if necessary

Actually, It looks like this doesn't completely work yet, but the sync
bombs on the lost_connection message so everything dies like it
should.

Good enough for now.

Synronizer should support this also, but since the ref kills the game
as soon as anyone disconnects, it doesn't matter.
