title: Get the physics stuff working in the branch

This involves:

- Change the code in branch/utils/shooter.c++ to have access to the
  state.
- Change the acceleration of particles with gravity and attraction to
  other objects.

To do this you will need to implement the whole architecture of the
game (All of the pieces tied together in one program), So this is very
non-trivial.

Not everything is implemented, and some things are implemented
completely.  However, I think it's good enough for now.
