Fix the while loop hack in SwithboxAdmin::makeGroup,
SwithboxAdmin::removeGroup

Find a solution that times out after a while, and doesn't constantly
check to see if things are working yet.

Looks good.  Thanks.

There is one small issue that I can think of.  If there are two
entities creating groups (say A and B), and A creates a group and then
B creates another group immediately afterwords.  B will get A's
announcement message first; It will signal the condition variable.
since B's group wont be setup yet (in 'groups').  B will see this as a
failure and return false.

However, this will never happen in our code (only one client will be
messing with groups), so I'm going to just make a note of it in the
code and leave it as is.

Committed code that uses conditional variables to block for a given
timeout value given in SwitchboxAdmin.hpp.
