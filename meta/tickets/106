It seems to be random.  I will launch it twice in a row and it will
work the second time but not the first.

For some reason launching still works.  For example if two people get
unresponsive screens and the third person gets a working one.  The
third person can still select the other two people and play a game
with them (The game launches on all three computers).

Any idea when this happens?  I've never experienced this either.

I have no clue, but it happens pretty repeatedly on the hydra
machines.

To test I've attached a switchbox-connect to before starting it and it
is sending the '/login' the '/list' and the '/players' is being sent.
So *everything* works.  It has to be an issue with the GUI code.
