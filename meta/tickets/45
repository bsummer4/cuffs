Create map class that can load a map, as well as can query with the
following class:

- Map Class
    - loadMap(filename)
    - pixel_type_t getPixel()
    - void explosion(int x, int y, float radius)

I have created the base for the map class. I need to change it to use
the new Coords class rather than int x, int y

Map now uses Coords Class as well as using int x, int y.

Map Class now functions correctly, and has tests that test it.

Although it does not handle error checking well yet, that's a problem
for Future John.
