Write the client code that talks to the ref.  It should:

- Connect to the switchbox.
- Send '/identify $username'.
- Wait for '/map mapfile'.
- Load the map into the renderer, and create the gamestate.
- Wait for '/start'.
- Wait for '/new player-$username player x y' for all players.
- Kick off the cmb and the interpret-physics-render pipeline.
- Wait for the user to quit.
- Exit

This seems to be done in game.c++.  Haven't tested extensively.
