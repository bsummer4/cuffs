title: A client not being available shouldn't kill the switchbox.

Problem Statement
=================

[John]
While writing the playback/recoder programs I encounterd a problem
with my Connection class. If I queue messages and kill the object fast
enough then the system the messages may never get sent. So what I've
done is made sure that the messages are sent out before the Class goes
away. The problem with this is, I think the messages get sent out, and
then the client leaves. But the switchbox dies with an assertion
failed when it tries to relay the massage back to the now gone
client. The send_message function fails.


Reproducing Problem
===================

Go into trunk/tests/utils and first create an input file. Here's what I use:

    -1 new_connection 0
    0 Hello how are you
    0 I am fine thanks.
    0 Okay bye
    -1 lost_connection 0

And I save it in script_one

Then (with the switchbox running) run playback

     ./playback localhost PORT script_one

I've had to run it a couple of times, but after a couple of tries it
should take down the switchbox.

Looks like you fixed it. I ran what was killing it before a bunch of
times and it seems to work. (how scientific of me)

resolved: fixed

I can't duplicate the problem, so I can't be sure.  However, I fixed
some logic that would cause your problem.  Make sure everything works
now.
