Focus more on the cases, they'll help guide our code. Test code can be
written later.

Initial checkin which begins on the functional tests. Still working on
getting  the benchmark  and edge  cases  tested. However,  I need  the
switchbox to  support logons  like we spoke  in those  previous emails
before any of the tests will pass.

Okay, all the functional and edge case tests are passing. The latency
test is not working reliably enough for me to have it running with the
tests.

Today I checked code into the improve-switchbox branch that enables
the latency/scalability checks.
