Made CMBgo and CMBtest. Need to link them to multiple machines tomorrow.

CELEBRATION! Test works. Throwing it in the repo.

I just went through this and there's a couple of things:

One you have the path to the script hard coded, I changed that so it
was relative to the script location.

It's not clear to me how to know if this test passes or not. The way
the autotools tests work are if the test returns a 0 then it passes,
if it returns non-zero it fails. It doesn't look like it ever checks
the output, and always claims to pass, unless one of the program dies
somehow.

Yeah, I realized that the test was wonky. I could thread off the send
message and the result fails return 0, else send messages. I planned
on rewriting it, but I'm busy with the ref. Should be done over the
Turkey Break. Along with the ref.

Are they all supposed to output the same thing?
Perhaps when I finish the sb_io thing it would just replace this? idk...

I was hoping this.

I'll rewrite the test when it's finished.

Too old. Now I'll just write more test cases.
